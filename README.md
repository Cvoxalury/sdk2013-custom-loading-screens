**Custom loading screens and loading bars for SDK2013 SP/MP**

**I. Overview**

This project started as an improvement of an <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Custom_loading_screen">existing tutorial</a> on Valve Developer Community.

The main goal was to replace the loading bars and add fully-controllable secondary elements such as the % readout, gameplay tips, or a rotating loading wheel.

Both are now achieved, although there's always room for improvement.

The project's been tested on SDK 2013 SP (main focus) and MP. Works in both, but MP lacks some elements such as the secondary loading bar for downloading external files.

**II. Functionality**

The loading screen works as a VGUI element that replaces the basic loading screen and its tied elements (such as the progress bar), done in clientmode_shared.cpp. 

The image is drawn based on what map is being loaded; however, there's no known way to know it immediately as it begins loading.

It is only at about 70% progress that the engine can be queried for the map name, and the loading background can be updated. 

If there's a .VMT present that matches the map name, at materials/vgui/loading, then that image will be used. If there isn't one, or the map name isn't yet known,
one of the default screens will be picked. There's 8 default sample screens provided, all recycling HL2/Episodes blurry menu backgrounds, and 1 named after a map,
ep2_outland_12a. So, when loading any map that isn't ep2_outland_12a, one of the defaults will be picked randomly; if loading that map, it will first show one of the
defaults, then update to a black texture (as specified in ep2_outland_12a.VMT).

The gameplay tips shown during loading are picked from the mod-specific txt file in resource/ folder. There are sample strings provided. Unfortunately, a hack had to
be used: I don't know of a way to scan ahead for a number of strings specified and pick random from their number. So, it assumes there's up to 32 strings, and picks
either a numbered string based on random, or the first string if the number goes beyond the number of found strings. If there's no strings defined at all, the tip
label remains empty, so as not to show an error message.
